A simple script to download LoC (Library of Congress) audio archives and
transcripts and metadata locally for further processing.

Requires LWP::Curl, HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath, JSON.

Which should be fixed.  LWP::Curl is nice but takes a lot of dependencies.

This is a part of a larger LoC Slave Narratives audio cleanup project.
